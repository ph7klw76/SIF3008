# Ginzburg-Landau Theory: A Detailed Technical Exploration

## 1. Introduction and Rationale

Superconductivity is a phase of matter where electrical resistance vanishes below a critical temperature $T_c$. Early phenomenological descriptions (e.g., London equations) captured key ideas like Meissner expulsion but did not fully explain how superconductors transition between normal and superconducting states.

In 1950, V. L. Ginzburg and L. D. Landau proposed a phenomenological free energy functional that incorporates a complex order parameter $\psi(r)$. This order parameter:

- Has a magnitude $|\psi|$ that measures the density of superconducting Cooper pairs.
- Has a phase that couples to the electromagnetic field and governs supercurrents.

Remarkably, despite its phenomenological roots, Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory accurately describes many superconducting phenomena, including Type I vs. Type II behavior, vortex states, and flux quantization. Later, BCS theory provided a microscopic foundation for these ideas, showing that Ginzburg-Landau naturally emerges near the critical temperature.

## 2. Defining the Ginzburg-Landau Free Energy

### 2.1 The Order Parameter $\psi(r)$

$\psi(r)$ is a complex-valued function:

$$
\psi(r) = |\psi(r)| e^{i\theta(r)}.
$$

- $|\psi(r)|^2$ corresponds to the local density of superconducting Cooper pairs.
- The phase $\theta(r)$ is crucial for supercurrent flow and magnetic flux quantization.

---

### 2.2 Phenomenological Form of the Free Energy

The Ginzburg-Landau theory posits that the total free energy $F$ of a superconductor can be written as a volume integral of a free energy density $f(r)$:

$$
F = \int_V f(r) \, d^3r.
$$

The standard GL free energy density $f$ has four main contributions:

Below, we dissect each term in detail, explaining why it is there and what it represents.

### 2.3 Detailed Meaning of Each Term

#### Term (1): $\alpha |\psi|^2$

- $\alpha$ is a (temperature-dependent) coefficient. Near $T_c$, it is common to set:
  
$$
  \alpha(T) = \alpha_0 \frac{T - T_c}{T_c},
$$

  where $\alpha_0 > 0$.

**Physical meaning**:
- If $\alpha > 0$ (above $T_c$), minimizing free energy is achieved by $\psi = 0$, i.e., the normal (non-superconducting) state.
- If $\alpha < 0$ (below $T_c$), having $\psi \neq 0$ lowers the free energy, favoring superconductivity.

---

#### Term (2): $\frac{\beta}{2} |\psi|^4$

- $\beta > 0$ ensures stability by preventing $|\psi|$ from blowing up.

**Physical meaning**:
- This is a self-interaction term that sets the equilibrium value of $|\psi|$ when $\alpha < 0$.
- Below $T_c$, combining (1) and (2) yields a “Mexican hat” potential in $\psi$-space, giving a nonzero minimum for $|\psi|$.

---

#### Term (3): $\frac{1}{2m} |(-i\hbar \nabla - 2e \mathbf{A}) \psi|^2$

- This is the kinetic energy of the superconducting condensate, with Cooper pair mass $m$ and charge $2e$.
- $\mathbf{A}$ is the magnetic vector potential, so $\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}$.
- The covariant derivative $(-i\hbar \nabla - 2e \mathbf{A})$ ensures minimal coupling between the superconducting pairs and the electromagnetic field.

**Physical meaning**:
- This term penalizes rapid spatial variations of $\psi$ and also describes how a supercurrent arises if $\psi$ has a phase gradient or the presence of a magnetic field.

---

#### Term (4): $\frac{|\mathbf{B}|^2}{2\mu_0}$

- This is the classical magnetic field energy.

**Physical meaning**:
- In a Meissner state (perfect expulsion of $\mathbf{B}$), the superconductor tries to reduce this term.
- However, in Type II superconductors above $H_{c1}$, partial magnetic flux penetration can lower the overall free energy when balanced with the other terms.

---

Hence, the total free energy is:

$$
F = \int \left[
\alpha |\psi|^2 + 
\frac{\beta}{2} |\psi|^4 +
\frac{1}{2m} |(-i\hbar \nabla - 2e \mathbf{A}) \psi|^2 +
\frac{|\mathbf{B}|^2}{2\mu_0}
\right] d^3r.
$$

## 3. Derivation of the Two Ginzburg-Landau Equations

To find the superconducting state that minimizes $F$, we take functional derivatives of $F$ with respect to $\psi^*$ and $\mathbf{A}$. These yield the two Ginzburg-Landau equations.

---

### 3.1 First GL Equation

#### Variation with Respect to $\psi^*$

We write:

$$
\frac{\delta F}{\delta \psi^*} = 0.
$$

After performing variations, the stationarity condition yields:

$$
\alpha \psi + \beta |\psi|^2 \psi + \frac{1}{2m} \left(-i\hbar \nabla - 2e \mathbf{A} \right)^2 \psi = 0.
$$

---

#### Physical Interpretation

- $\alpha \psi + \beta |\psi|^2 \psi$: Encodes the thermodynamic preference for $\psi = 0$ vs. $\psi \neq 0$.
- $\left(-i\hbar \nabla - 2e \mathbf{A} \right)^2 \psi$: Represents spatial coherence (penalizing variations in $\psi$) and coupling to the magnetic field ($\mathbf{A}$).

---

### 3.2 Second GL Equation

#### Variation with Respect to $\mathbf{A}$

We write:

$$
\frac{\delta F}{\delta \mathbf{A}} = 0.
$$

This variation yields:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J},
$$

where the supercurrent density $\mathbf{J}$ is:

$$
\mathbf{J} = -\frac{2e}{2m} \text{Re} \left[\psi^* \left(-i\hbar \nabla - 2e \mathbf{A} \right) \psi \right].
$$

---

#### Physical Interpretation

- $\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}$ is Ampère’s law in magnetostatics.
- $\mathbf{J}$ depends on the local value of $\psi$ and $\mathbf{A}$, describing how magnetic fields are rearranged by supercurrents to minimize the free energy.
Thus, the Second Ginzburg-Landau Equation states that the supercurrent density $\mathbf{J}$ must satisfy:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}.
$$

---

# 4. Physical Consequences and Examples

## 4.1 Uniform Case (No Magnetic Field)

For a simple example, assume $\mathbf{A} = 0$ and $\psi(r)$ is spatially uniform. Then the gradient term vanishes:

$$
\nabla \psi = 0 \implies |D^\wedge \psi|^2 = 0.
$$

The free energy density simplifies to:

$$
f = \alpha |\psi|^2 + \frac{\beta}{2} |\psi|^4.
$$

### Minimization

The first GL equation becomes:

$$
\alpha \psi + \beta |\psi|^2 \psi = 0.
$$

If $\psi \neq 0$, we can divide by $\psi$, yielding:

$$
\alpha + \beta |\psi|^2 = 0.
$$

Hence, the equilibrium amplitude is:

$$
|\psi|^2 = -\frac{\alpha}{\beta}.
$$

- **Above $T_c$:** $\alpha > 0 \implies$ only $\psi = 0$ solves the equation.
- **Below $T_c$:** $\alpha < 0 \implies |\psi|^2 = -\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$, a finite nonzero value.

This captures the continuous phase transition at $T_c$.

## 4.2 Magnetic Penetration Depth $\lambda$ and Coherence Length $\xi$

From the GL equations, one can extract two fundamental length scales:

### Coherence Length $\xi$

Characterizes how quickly $\psi$ changes in space. Roughly:

$$
\xi \sim \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2m |\alpha|}}.
$$

- **Physically:** $\xi$ is the distance over which the superconducting order parameter “heals” from 0 to its bulk value.

### Penetration Depth $\lambda$

Characterizes how deeply a magnetic field penetrates into a superconductor:

$$
\lambda \sim \sqrt{\frac{m}{\mu_0 2 e^2 |\psi|^2}}.
$$

- This arises by inserting the supercurrent $\mathbf{J}$ into Maxwell’s equations.
- **Larger $\lambda$:** Field decays more gradually inside the material.

### The Ratio $\kappa = \lambda / \xi$ Defines:

- **Type I superconductors:** $\kappa < \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.
- **Type II superconductors:** $\kappa > \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

## 4.3 Vortex Solutions in Type II Superconductors

When $H_{c1} < H < H_{c2}$, the GL equations allow mixed-state solutions with vortices:

1. **Vortex Core:** $\psi \approx 0$, letting magnetic field lines pass through. Each vortex carries one flux quantum:

$$
   \Phi_0 = \frac{h}{2e}.
$$

2. **Superconducting Region:** $\psi \approx \text{constant}$ in between the vortices.

3. **Vortex Lattice (Abrikosov lattice):** Minimizing free energy often leads to a hexagonal or triangular lattice arrangement of vortices.

This phenomenon underlies quantum locking and flux pinning, enabling stable levitation and other applications.

---

# 5. Step-by-Step Example: Deriving the Supercurrent Expression

Let’s illustrate a detailed derivation for the supercurrent $\mathbf{J}$ in the second GL equation:

### Start with the Kinetic Term:

$$
F_{\text{kin}} = \int \frac{1}{2m} |D^\wedge \psi|^2 \, d^3r, \quad D^\wedge = -i\hbar \nabla - 2e \mathbf{A}.
$$

Rewrite:

$$
|D^\wedge \psi|^2 = (D^\wedge \psi)^* (D^\wedge \psi).
$$

Thus:

$$
F_{\text{kin}} = \int \frac{1}{2m} \left[(D^\wedge \psi)^* (D^\wedge \psi)\right] \, d^3r.
$$

Notice that $\mathbf{A}$ appears linearly in $D^\wedge$. Therefore, the functional derivative:

$$
\frac{\delta}{\delta \mathbf{A}} \left[(D^\wedge \psi)^* (D^\wedge \psi)\right]
$$

will produce terms proportional to $\psi^* \psi$ and $\nabla \psi$.

### Obtain the Supercurrent Density $\mathbf{J}$:

$$
\mathbf{J} = -\frac{\delta F_{\text{kin}}}{\delta \mathbf{A}} = -\frac{2e}{2m} \text{Re} \left[\psi^* \left(-i\hbar \nabla - 2e \mathbf{A}\right) \psi \right].
$$

**Interpretation**:

- The supercurrent is proportional to the local condensate density $|\psi|^2$.
- There is a contribution from the phase gradient ($\nabla \theta$) that yields persistent currents.
- Coupling to $\mathbf{A}$ ensures that the system respects gauge invariance and that magnetic fields can modify the current distribution.

Finally, by insisting:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J},
$$

we get the second GL equation in a physically transparent form, linking the supercurrent to the local magnetic field.

# 6. Putting It All Together

### 6.1 Key Insights

- Ginzburg-Landau theory unifies thermodynamics (through $\alpha$ and $\beta$) with electromagnetism (through $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{B}$) and the quantum order parameter $\psi$.
- The first GL equation tells you how $\psi$ (the superconducting gap function) arranges itself spatially.
- The second GL equation relates the magnetic field to the supercurrent, ensuring Maxwell’s equations are satisfied.
- Two fundamental length scales, $\xi$ and $\lambda$, emerge naturally, controlling the spatial variation of $\psi$ and $\mathbf{B}$.

---

### 6.2 Type I vs. Type II Superconductors

- **Type I ($\kappa < \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$):** Abrupt transition, complete expulsion of $\mathbf{B}$ (Meissner) until $H_c$.
- **Type II ($\kappa > \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$):** Allows a mixed or vortex state for $H_{c1} < H < H_{c2}$.

---

### 6.3 Practical Applications

1. **Vortex Pinning:** Leads to stable levitation and “quantum locking” in maglev applications.
2. **Superconducting Magnets:** Used in MRI machines due to their ability to carry high currents without dissipation.
