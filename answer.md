## Question:In the formation of a Cooper pair, why is it necessary for the two electrons to have opposite momenta and opposite spins? Also, during lattice-mediated attraction, how does an electron become attracted to the positive potential (or 'trail') left behind by another electron as it moves through the lattice, given that electrons normally repel each other due to Coulomb repulsion?"

# Introduction

Superconductivity,the complete loss of electrical resistance below a critical temperature arises from the formation of bound pairs of electrons, known as Cooper pairs. Although electrons repel via Coulomb forces, in a crystal they can attract one another through lattice vibrations (phonons). This blog explains:

- Why Cooper pairs form with opposite momenta and spins.
- How phonon exchange generates an effective attraction between all‐repelling electrons.
- Where the simple “wake‐trail” cartoon helps—and where it misleads.

## 1. Opposite Momenta: Energy Minimization at the Fermi Surface

Consider two electrons added just above a filled Fermi sea. Cooper’s 1956 calculation showed that an arbitrarily weak attractive interaction produces a bound state only if the pair’s center‐of‐mass momentum

$$
K = k_1 + k_2
$$

vanishes (i.e.\ $k_2 = -k_1$) [1].

**Physical picture**: If $K = 0$, both electrons can occupy states exactly on the Fermi surface before and after pairing, incurring no extra kinetic‐energy cost.

**Mathematical sketch**: Solving the two‐electron Schrödinger equation in a weak, constant attraction $V<0$ within an energy shell $\pm \hbar \omega_D$ around $E_F$ yields a bound energy

$$
E_b \approx 2E_F - 2\hbar \omega_D \, e^{-2/N(0)\lvert V \rvert}
$$

only in the $K=0$ channel [1].

Opposite momenta maximize the phase‐space for pairing and make binding possible for vanishingly small $V$.

## 2. Opposite Spins: Fermi Statistics and Antisymmetry

Electrons are fermions; their two‐particle wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange:

$$
\Psi(r_1, s_1; \, r_2, s_2) = -\, \Psi(r_2, s_2; \, r_1, s_1).
$$

For the lowest‐energy (s-wave, $\ell=0$) state the spatial part $\psi(r_1 - r_2)$ is symmetric, so the spin part must be antisymmetric ⇒ a singlet:

$$
\chi_{\text{singlet}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\lvert \uparrow \downarrow \rangle - \lvert \downarrow \uparrow \rangle).
$$

Opposite spins (a spin-singlet) ensure the overall wavefunction respects Fermi‐Dirac statistics [2].

## 3. Phonon-Mediated Attraction: From Cartoon to Formalism

### 3.1 The “Wake‐Trail” Metaphor

**Cartoon**: Electron 1 races past heavy ions, attracting them slightly and leaving a positive “wake” behind. Electron 2 feels this lingering positive region and is drawn in.
Conveys the retardation ions move much more slowly than electrons, so the lattice distortion persists long enough to mediate attraction.

### 3.2 Why the Cartoon Misleads on Momentum

The naive picture might suggest Electron 2 simply “falls into the same $k$-state” as Electron 1. That cannot happen without violating momentum conservation and energy minimization:

**Momentum bookkeeping**

- Electron 1 emits a virtual phonon of momentum $q$, going from $k \rightarrow k - q$.
- Electron 2 absorbs that phonon, $k' \rightarrow k' + q$.

The most attractive channel occurs when $k' = -k$ (so $k' + q = k$), giving the paired states $(k, -k)$ and total $K=0$.

**Energy cost**

A pair in $(k, k)$ would have $K=2k$, forcing at least one electron off the Fermi surface and incurring a kinetic penalty.

Pairing as $(k, -k)$ lets both remain at $E_F$, maximizing binding.

## 4. Summary

- Opposite momentum $(k, -k)$ → no kinetic‐energy penalty, maximal phase space.
- Opposite spin (singlet) → antisymmetry of the fermionic wavefunction.
- Phonon exchange → a retarded, momentum-conserving attraction, best in the $K=0$ channel.
- **Cartoon caveat**: The “wake” helps intuition about retardation, but true pairing arises from momentum-conserving phonon processes, not a literal “follow-the-trail” into the same $k$-state.
